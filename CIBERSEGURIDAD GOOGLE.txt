Un Agente de amenaza, o atacante malicioso, es cualquier persona o grupo que presenta un riesgo para la Seguridad. Este riesgo puede estar relacionado con computadoras, aplicaciones, redes y datos.

Una amenaza interna puede ser un empleado actual o antiguo, un proveedor externo o un socio de confianza que suponga un riesgo para la Seguridad. A veces, una amenaza interna es accidental. Por ejemplo, un empleado que haga clic accidentalmente en un enlace de correo electrónico malicioso se consideraría una amenaza accidental. Otras veces, el actor de la amenaza interna se involucra intencionadamente en actividades de riesgo, como el acceso no autorizado a los datos.

Seguridad de red es la práctica de mantener la infraestructura de red de una organización a salvo de accesos no autorizados. Esto incluye datos, servicios, sistemas y dispositivos que se almacenan en la red de una organización.

Seguridad de la nube es el proceso de garantizar que los activos almacenados en la nube están correctamente configurados, o establecidos, y que el acceso a esos activos está limitado a los usuarios autorizados. La nube es una red formada por un conjunto de servidores u ordenadores que almacenan recursos y datos en ubicaciones físicas remotas conocidas como centros de datos a los que se puede acceder a través de Internet. La Seguridad de la nube es un subcampo creciente de la Ciberseguridad que se centra específicamente en la protección de los datos, las aplicaciones y la infraestructura en la nube.

Security posture refers to an organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change.

Domains:

1. security and risk management. There are several areas of focus for this domain: defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations. Let's discuss each area of focus in more detail.

Risk mitigation means having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach.

Business continuity relates to an organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.

2. The asset security domain is focused on securing digital and physical assets.

3. security architecture and engineering. This domain is focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data.

4.communication and network security, which is mainly focused on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. 

5. identity and access management, or IAM. And it's focused on access and authorization to keep data secure by making sure users follow established policies to control and manage assets. 

6. security assessment and testing. This domain focuses on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

7.  The security operations domain is focused on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.

8. software development security. This domain focuses on using secure coding practices. As you may remember, secure coding practices are recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A threat is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets. One example of a threat is a social engineering attack. Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

 A risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. Think of a risk as the likelihood of a threat occurring.

A low-risk asset is information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised.

A medium-risk asset might include information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations.

A high-risk asset is any information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised, would have a severe negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation. This could include leaked assets with SPII, PII, or intellectual property.

A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat. And it's worth noting that both a vulnerability and threat must be present for there to be a risk.

ProxyLogon: A pre-authenticated vulnerability that affects the Microsoft Exchange server. This means a threat actor can complete a user authentication process to deploy malicious code from a remote location.

ZeroLogon: A vulnerability in Microsoft’s Netlogon authentication protocol. An authentication protocol is a way to verify a person's identity. Netlogon is a service that ensures a user’s identity before allowing access to a website's location.

Log4Shell: Allows attackers to run Java code on someone else’s computer or leak sensitive information. It does this by enabling a remote attacker to take control of devices connected to the internet and run malicious code.

PetitPotam: Affects Windows New Technology Local Area Network (LAN) Manager (NTLM). It is a theft technique that allows a LAN-based attacker to initiate an authentication request.

Security logging and monitoring failures: Insufficient logging and monitoring capabilities that result in attackers exploiting vulnerabilities without the organization knowing it

Server-side request forgery: Allows attackers to manipulate a server-side application into accessing and updating backend resources. It can also allow threat actors to steal data.

Ransomware is a malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data then demand payment to restore access. 

key impacts of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities:

1. financial impact. When an organization's assets are compromised by an attack, such as the use of malware, the financial consequences can be significant for a variety of reasons. These can include interrupted production and services, the cost to correct the issue, and fines if assets are compromised because of non-compliance with laws and regulations.

2. identity theft. Organizations must decide whether to store private customer, employee, and outside vendor data, and for how long. Storing any type of sensitive data presents a risk to the organization. Sensitive data can include personally identifiable information, or PII, which can be sold or leaked through the dark web.

3. damage to an organization's reputation. A solid customer base supports an organization's mission, vision, and financial goals. An exploited vulnerability can lead customers to seek new business relationships with competitors or create bad press that causes permanent damage to an organization's reputation. 

SEVEN STEPS IN THE RMF(RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK):

1.Prepare refers to activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs. As an entry-level analyst, you'll likely use this step to monitor for risks and identify controls that can be used to reduce those risks.

2.categorize, which is used to develop risk management processes and tasks. Security professionals then use those processes and develop tasks by thinking about how the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and information can be impacted by risk.

3.Select means to choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization. An example of the select step would be keeping a playbook up-to-date or helping to manage other documentation that allows you and your team to address issues more efficiently.

4. implement security and privacy plans for the organization. Having good plans in place is essential for minimizing the impact of ongoing security risks.

5.Assess means to determine if established controls are implemented correctly. An organization always wants to operate as efficiently as possible. So it's essential to take the time to analyze whether the implemented protocols, procedures, and controls that are in place are meeting organizational needs. 

6.Authorize means being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization. As an analyst, the authorization step could involve generating reports, developing plans of action, and establishing project milestones that are aligned to your organization's security goals.

7. Monitor means to be aware of how systems are operating. Assessing and maintaining technical operations are tasks that analysts complete daily. Part of maintaining a low level of risk for an organization is knowing how the current systems support the organization's security goals.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy, such as social engineering attacks and ransomware.

Other security frameworks provide guidance for how to prevent, detect, and respond to security breaches. This is particularly important when trying to protect an organization from social engineering attacks like phishing that target their employees.

Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. In this video, we'll discuss three common types of controls: encryption, authentication, and authorization.

Encryption is the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format. Typically, encryption involves converting data from plaintext to ciphertext. Ciphertext is the raw, encoded message that's unreadable to humans and computers. Ciphertext data cannot be read until it's been decrypted into its original plaintext form. Encryption is used to ensure confidentiality of sensitive data, such as customers' account information or social security numbers.

Authentication is the process of verifying who someone or something is. A real-world example of authentication is logging into a website with your username and password. This basic form of authentication proves that you know the username and password and should be allowed to access the website. More advanced methods of authentication, such as multi-factor authentication, or MFA, challenge the user to demonstrate that they are who they claim to be by requiring both a password and an additional form of authentication, like a security code or biometrics, such as a fingerprint, voice, or face scan.

Biometrics are unique physical characteristics that can be used to verify a person's identity.

Authorization refers to the concept of granting access to specific resources within a system. Essentially, authorization is used to verify that a person has permission to access a resource.

The CIA triad is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. As a reminder, the three letters in the CIA triad stand for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Confidentiality(essential) means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data. Sensitive data should be available on a "need to know" basis, so that only the people who are authorized to handle certain assets or data have access.

Integrity(priority) means that the data is correct, authentic, and reliable. Determining the integrity of data and analyzing how it's used will help you, as a security professional, decide whether the data can or cannot be trusted.

Availability(critical) means that the data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it. Inaccessible data isn't useful and can prevent people from being able to do their jobs. As a security professional, ensuring that systems, networks, and applications are functioning properly to allow for timely and reliable access, may be a part of your everyday work responsibilities.


The CSF(NIST Cybersecurity Framework) is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. This framework is widely respected and essential for maintaining security regardless of the organization you work for.

The NIST CSF also expands into the protection of the United States federal government with NIST special publication, or SP 800-53. It provides a unified framework for protecting the security of information systems within the federal government, including the systems provided by private companies for federal government use.

Five functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework:

1. identify, which is related to the management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organization's people and assets. 

2. protect, which is the strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.

3. detect, which means identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections.

4. respond, which means making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, and implement improvements to the security process.

5. recover, which is the process of returning affected systems back to normal operation.

OWASP principle: 
1. is to minimize the attack surface area. 
2. The principle of least privilege means making sure that users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks. 
3. defense in depth. Defense in depth means that an organization should have multiple security controls that address risks and threats in different ways. 
4.  separation of duties, which can be used to prevent individuals from carrying out fraudulent or illegal activities. This principle means that no one should be given so many privileges that they can misuse the system. 
5. Keep security simple is the next principle. As the name suggests, when implementing security controls, unnecessarily complicated solutions should be avoided because they can become unmanageable.
6. fix security issues correctly. Technology is a great tool, but can also present challenges. When a security incident occurs, security professionals are expected to identify the root cause quickly. From there, it's important to correct any identified vulnerabilities and conduct tests to ensure that repairs are successful.

A security audit is a review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations.

An internal security audit is typically conducted by a team of people that might include an organization's compliance officer, security manager, and other security team members. Internal security audits are used to help improve an organization's security posture and help organizations avoid fines from governing agencies due to a lack of compliance. Internal security audits help security teams identify organizational risk, assess controls, and correct compliance issues.

Common elementes of internal audits:
1. Scope refers to the specific criteria of an internal security audit. Scope requires organizations to identify people, assets, policies, procedures, and technologies that might impact an organization's security posture.

2. conducting a risk assessment, which is focused on identifying potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. This helps organizations consider what security measures should be implemented and monitored to ensure the safety of assets. Similar to establishing the scope and goals, a risk assessment is oftentimes completed by managers or other stakeholders.

3. A controls assessment involves closely reviewing an organization's existing assets, then evaluating potential risks to those assets, to ensure internal controls and processes are effective. To do this, entry-level analysts might be tasked with classifying controls into the following categories: administrative controls, technical controls, and physical controls.

4. The next element is determining whether or not the organization is adhering to necessary compliance regulations. As a reminder, compliance regulations are laws that organizations must follow to ensure private data remains secure. 

5. communication. Once the internal security audit is complete, results and recommendations need to be communicated to stakeholders. In general, this type of communication summarizes the scope and goals of the audit.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a log is a record of events that occur within an organization's systems and networks. 

A firewall log is a record of attempted or established connections for incoming traffic from the internet. It also includes outbound requests to the internet from within the network.

A network log is a record of all computers and devices that enter and leave the network. It also records connections between devices and services on the network.

A server log is a record of events related to services such as websites, emails, or file shares. It includes actions such as login, password, and username requests.

A security information and event management, or SIEM, tool is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. It provides real-time visibility, event monitoring and analysis, and automated alerts. It also stores all log data in a centralized location.

Metrics are key technical attributes such as response time, availability, and failure rate, which are used to assess the performance of a software application.

Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) is a collection of applications, tools, and workflows that uses automation to respond to security events. Essentially, this means that handling common security-related incidents with the use of SIEM tools is expected to become a more streamlined process requiring less manual intervention. This frees up security analysts to handle more complex and uncommon incidents that, consequently, can’t be automated with a SOAR. Nevertheless, the expectation is for cybersecurity-related platforms to communicate and interact with one another. Although the technology allowing interconnected systems and devices to communicate with each other exists, it is still a work in progress.

Self-hosted SIEM tools require organizations to install, operate, and maintain the tool using their own physical infrastructure, such as server capacity. These applications are then managed and maintained by the organization's IT department, rather than a third party vendor. Self-hosted SIEM tools are ideal when an organization is required to maintain physical control over confidential data.

cloud-hosted SIEM tools are maintained and managed by the SIEM providers, making them accessible through the internet. Cloud-hosted SIEM tools are ideal for organizations that don't want to invest in creating and maintaining their own infrastructure.

Or, an organization can choose to use a combination of both self-hosted and cloud-hosted SIEM tools, known as a hybrid solution. Organizations might choose a hybrid SIEM solution to leverage the benefits of the cloud while also maintaining physical control over confidential data.

Splunk is a data analysis platform and Splunk Enterprise provides SIEM solutions. 

Splunk Enterprise is a self-hosted tool used to retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data to provide security information and alerts in real-time.

Splunk Cloud is a cloud-hosted tool used to collect, search, and monitor log data. Splunk Cloud is helpful for organizations running hybrid or cloud-only environments, where some or all of the organization's services are in the cloud.

Chronicle is a cloud-native tool designed to retain, analyze, and search data. Chronicle provides log monitoring, data analysis, and data collection. Like cloud-hosted tools, cloud-native tools are also fully maintained and managed by the vendor. But cloud-native tools are specifically designed to take full advantage of cloud computing capabilities such as availability, flexibility, and scalability.

A Denial of Service attack is a class of attacks where the attacker prevents the compromised system from performing legitimate activity or responding to legitimate traffic. 

An on-path attack happens when a hacker intercepts the communication between two devices or servers that have a trusted relationship. The transmission between these two trusted network devices could contain valuable information like usernames and passwords that the malicious actor can collect. An on-path attack is sometimes referred to as a meddler-in-the middle attack because the hacker is hiding in the middle of communications between two trusted parties.

What is OS Hardening?

The operating system acts as the bridge between your hardware and software. If it's vulnerable, your entire network could be at risk.
OS hardening involves regular and one-time tasks to strengthen your system's security.
Regular OS Hardening Tasks

Patch Updates: Regularly updating your OS with the latest patches from vendors is crucial to fix security vulnerabilities and protect against malicious actors.
Hardware/Software Disposal: Properly wiping and disposing of old hardware and deleting unused software applications helps eliminate potential entry points for attackers.

A baseline configuration is a documented set of specifications within a system that is used as a basis for future builds, releases, and updates. For example, a baseline may contain a firewall rule with a list of allowed and disallowed network ports. If a security team suspects unusual activity affecting the OS, they can compare the current configuration to the baseline and make sure that nothing has been changed.

MFA is a security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network. Ways of identifying yourself include something you know, like a password, something you have like an ID card, or something unique about you, like your fingerprint.

A brute force attack is a trial-and-error process of discovering private information. There are different types of brute force attacks that malicious actors use to guess passwords, including: 

Simple brute force attacks. When attackers try to guess a user's login credentials, it’s considered a simple brute force attack. They might do this by entering any combination of usernames and passwords that they can think of until they find the one that works.

Dictionary attacks use a similar technique. In dictionary attacks, attackers use a list of commonly used passwords and stolen credentials from previous breaches to access a system. These are called “dictionary” attacks because attackers originally used a list of words from the dictionary to guess the passwords, before complex password rules became a common security practice. 

Virtual machines (VMs) are software versions of physical computers. VMs provide an additional layer of security for an organization because they can be used to run code in an isolated environment, preventing malicious code from affecting the rest of the computer or system. VMs can also be deleted and replaced by a pristine image after testing malware. 

A sandbox is a type of testing environment that allows you to execute software or programs separate from your network. They are commonly used for testing patches, identifying and addressing bugs, or detecting cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Sandboxes can also be used to evaluate suspicious software, evaluate files containing malicious code, and simulate attack scenarios.

operating system? It's the interface between the computer hardware and the user. The operating system, or the OS as it's commonly called, is responsible for making the computer run as efficiently as possible while also making it easy to use. Hardware may be another new term. Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer.

User
The first part of the process is the user. The user initiates the process by having something they want to accomplish on the computer. Right now, you’re a user!  You’ve initiated the process of accessing this reading.

Application
The application is the software program that users interact with to complete a task. For example, if you want to calculate something, you would use the calculator application. If you want to write a report, you would use a word processing application. This is the second part of the process.

Operating system
The operating system receives the user’s request from the application. It’s the operating system’s job to interpret the request and direct its flow. In order to complete the task, the operating system sends it on to applicable components of the hardware. 

Hardware
The hardware is where all the processing is done to complete the tasks initiated by the user. For example, when a user wants to calculate a number, the CPU figures out the answer. As another example, when a user wants to save a file, another component of the hardware, the hard drive, handles this task. 

After the work is done by the hardware, it sends the output back through the operating system to the application so that it can display the results to the user.

A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual version of a physical computer. Virtual machines are one example of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of using software to create virtual representations of various physical machines. 

Random Access Memory (RAM) is a hardware component used for short-term memory. If a computer has 16GB of RAM, it can host three virtual machines so that the physical computer and virtual machines each have 4GB of RAM. Also, each of these virtual machines would have their own operating system and function similarly to a typical computer.

pwd prints the working directory onto the screen.

cd navigates between directories.

ls displays the names of files and directories in the current working directory.

cat displays the content of a file. 

head command. It displays just the beginning of a file, by default ten lines.

The tail command does the opposite of head. This command can be used to display just the end of a file, by default 10 lines. Entering tail updates.txt returns only the last 10 lines of the updates.txt file.

The less command returns the content of a file one page at a time. For example, entering less updates.txt changes the terminal window to display the contents of updates.txt one page at a time. This allows you to easily move forward and backward through the content. 

/home: Each user in the system gets their own home directory.

/bin: This directory stands for “binary” and contains binary files and other executables. Executables are files that contain a series of commands a computer needs to follow to run programs and perform other functions.

/etc: This directory stores the system’s configuration files.

/tmp: This directory stores many temporary files. The /tmp directory is commonly used by attackers because anyone in the system can modify data in these files.

The touch command creates a new file.

rm command removes or deletes a file. 

The mv command moves a file or directory to new location.

cp copies a file or directory into a new location.

read permissions means contents on the file can be read.

Write permissions on a file allow modifications of contents of the file. On a directory, write permissions indicate that new files can be created in that directory.

Execute permissions on files mean that the file can be executed if it's an executable file. Execute permissions on directories allow users to enter into a directory and access its files.

The user is the owner of the file. When you create a file, you become the owner of the file, but the ownership can be changed. 

Group is the next type. Every user is a part of a certain group. A group consists of several users, and this is one way to manage a multi-user environment.

Other can be considered all other users on the system. Basically, anyone else with access to the system belongs to this group.

The first character indicates the file type. As shown in this example, d is used to indicate it is a directory. If this character contains a hyphen instead, it would be a regular file. The second, third, and fourth characters indicate the permissions for the user. In this example, r indicates the user has read permissions, w indicates the user has write permissions, and x indicates the user has execute permissions. If one of these permissions was missing, there would be a hyphen instead of the letter. In the same way, the fifth, sixth, and seventh characters indicate permissions for the next owner type group. As it shows here, the type group also has read, write, and execute permissions. There are no hyphens to indicate that any of these permissions haven't been granted. Finally, the eighth through tenth characters indicate permissions for the last owner type: other. They also have read, write, and execute permissions in this example.

ls -a: Displays hidden files. Hidden files start with a period (.) at the beginning.

ls -l: Displays permissions to files and directories. Also displays other additional information, including owner name, group, file size, and the time of last modification.

ls -la: Displays permissions to files and directories, including hidden files. This is a combination of the other two options.

The chmod  command can help you manage this authorization. The chmod command changes permissions on files and directories.

read: for files, this is the ability to read the file contents; for directories, this is the ability to read all contents in the directory including both files and subdirectories

write: for files, this is the ability to make modifications on the file contents; for directories, this is the ability to create new files in the directory

execute: for files, this is the ability to execute the file if it’s a program; for directories, this is the ability to enter the directory and access its files

Absolute file path: The full file path, which starts from the root

Standard input: Information received by the OS via the command line

Standard output: Information returned by the OS through the shell

The man command displays information on other commands and how they work. It’s short for “manual.” To search for information on a command, enter the command after man. 	

The apropos command searches the man page descriptions for a specified string. Man pages can be lengthy and difficult to search through if you’re looking for a specific keyword. To use apropos, enter the keyword after apropos. You can also include the -a option to search for multiple words. For example, entering apropos -a graph editor outputs man pages that contain both the words “graph" and "editor” in their descriptions.

The whatis command displays a description of a command on a single line. For example, entering whatis nano outputs the description of nano. This command is useful when you don't need a detailed description, just a general idea of the command. This might be as a reminder. Or, it might be after you discover a new command through a colleague or online resource and want to know more.

a risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.

an asset is an item perceived as having value to an organization.

a threat is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.

a vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat.

asset classification is the practice of labeling assets based on the sensitivity and importance to an organization.

Restricted is the highest level. This category is reserved for incredibly sensitive assets,  like need-to-know information.

Confidential refers to assets whose disclosure may lead to a significant negative impact on an organization.

Internal-only describes assets that are available to employees and business partners.

Public is the lowest level of classification. These assets have no negative consequences to the organization if they’re released.

Data is information that is translated, processed, or stored by a computer. We live in a connected world.

Data in use is data being accessed by one or more users.

Data in transit is data traveling from one point to another.

Data at rest is data not currently being accessed.

Information security, or InfoSec, is the practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users.

Software as a service (SaaS)
SaaS refers to front-end applications that users access via a web browser. The service providers host, manage, and maintain all of the back-end systems for those applications. Common examples of SaaS services include applications like Gmail™ email service, Slack, and Zoom software.

Platform as a service (PaaS)
PaaS refers to back-end application development tools that clients can access online. Developers use these resources to write code and build, manage, and deploy their own apps. Meanwhile, the cloud service providers host and maintain the back-end hardware and software that the apps use to operate. Some examples of PaaS services include Google App Engine™ platform, Heroku®, and VMware Cloud Foundry. 

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
IaaS customers are given remote access to a range of back-end systems that are hosted by the cloud service provider. This includes data processing servers, storage, networking resources, and more. Resources are commonly licensed as needed, making it a cost-effective alternative to buying and maintaining on premises.

Misconfiguration is one of the biggest concerns. Customers of cloud-based services are responsible for configuring their own security environment. Oftentimes, they use out-of-the-box configurations that fail to address their specific security objectives.

Cloud-native breaches are more likely to occur due to misconfigured services.

Monitoring access might be difficult depending on the client and level of service.

Meeting regulatory standards is also a concern, particularly in industries that are required by law to follow specific requirements such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR.

A policy in security is a set of rules that reduce risk and protects information. 

Standards are the next part. These have a tactical function, as they concern how well we're protecting assets. 

Procedures are step-by-step instructions to perform a specific security task.

Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations.

Regulations are rules set by a government or other authority to control the way something is done. 

The core is basically a simplified version of the functions, or duties, of a security plan. 

Tiers. These provide security teams with a way to measure

The CSF profiles are pre-made templates of the NIST CSF that are developed by a team of industry experts. 

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk

Technical control types include the many technologies used to protect assets. This includes encryption, authentication systems, and others.

Operational controls relate to maintaining the day-to-day security environment. Generally, people perform these controls like awareness training and incident response.

Managerial controls are centered around how the other two reduce risk. Examples of management controls include policies, standards, and procedures.

PII is any information used to infer an individual's identity. Personally identifiable information, or PII, refers to information that can be used to contact or locate someone.

PHI stands for protected health information.  In the U.S., it is regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which defines PHI as “information that relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual.” In the EU, PHI has a similar definition but it is regulated by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

SPII is a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines. The S stands for sensitive, meaning this is a type of personally identifiable information that should only be accessed on a need-to-know basis, such as a bank account number or login credentials.

Information privacy refers to the protection of unauthorized access and distribution of data.

Information security (InfoSec) refers to the practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users.

GDPR is a set of rules and regulations developed by the European Union (EU) that puts data owners in total control of their personal information.

PCI DSS is a set of security standards formed by major organizations in the financial industry. This regulation aims to secure credit and debit card transactions against data theft and fraud.

HIPAA is a U.S. law that requires the protection of sensitive patient health information. HIPAA prohibits the disclosure of a person's medical information without their knowledge and consent.

A security audit is a review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations.

A security assessment is a check to determine how resilient current security implementations are against threats.

Cryptography is the process of transforming information into a form that unintended readers can't understand.

brute force attack, a trial-and-error process of discovering private information.

Public key infrastructure, or PKI, is an encryption framework that secures the exchange of information online.

Asymmetric encryption involves the use of a public and private key pair for encryption and decryption of data.

Symmetric encryption, on the other hand, is a faster and simpler approach to key management. Symmetric encryption involves the use of a single secret key to exchange information.

A digital certificate is a file that verifies the identity of a public key holder.

Cipher: an algorithm that encrypts information

A hash function is an algorithm that produces a code that can't be decrypted.

This is known as non-repudiation, the concept that authenticity of information can't be denied.

A rainbow table is a file of pre-generated hash values and their associated plaintext. They’re like dictionaries of weak passwords.

Salting is an additional safeguard that's used to strengthen hash functions. A salt is a random string of characters that's added to data before it's hashed.

 access controls, the security controls that manage access, authorization, and accountability of information

Authentication systems are access controls that serve a very basic purpose.

Authentication by knowledge refers to something the user knows, like a password or the answer to a security question they provided previously.

Another factor is ownership, referring to something the user possesses. A commonly used type of authentication by ownership is a one-time passcode, or OTP. You've probably experienced these at one time or another. They're a random number sequence that an application or website will send you via text or email and ask you to provide.

characteristic. Authentication by this factor is something the user is. Biometrics, like fingerprint scans on your smartphone, are example of this type of authentication. While not used everywhere, this form of authentication is becoming more common because it's much tougher for criminals to impersonate someone if they have to mimic a fingerprint or facial scan as opposed to a password.

Single sign-on, or SSO, is a technology that combines several different logins into one.

Multi-factor authentication, or MFA, is a security measure, which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network.

Authorization is linked to the idea that access to information only lasts as long as needed.

Separation of duties is the principle that users should not be given levels of authorization that will allow them to misuse a system.

HTTP uses what is known as basic auth, the technology used to establish a user's request to access a server. Basic auth works by sending an identifier every time a user communicates with a web page.

OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol that shares designated access between applications.

An API token is a small block of encrypted code that contains information about a user.

Accounting is the practice of monitoring the access logs of a system.

 A session ID is a unique token that identifies a user and their device while accessing the system.

A session cookie is a token that websites use to validate a session and determine how long that session should last. 

Session hijacking is an event when attackers obtain a legitimate user's session ID.

The principle of least privilege in which a user is only granted the minimum level of access and authorization required to complete a task or function.

 Identity and access management (IAM) is a collection of processes and technologies that helps organizations manage digital identities in their environment.

Knowledge, or something the user knows

Ownership, or something the user possesses

Characteristic, or something the user is

User provisioning is the process of creating and maintaining a user's digital identity.

MAC is the strictest of the three frameworks. Authorization in this model is based on a strict need-to-know basis. 

DAC is typically applied when a data owner decides appropriate levels of access. One example of DAC is when the owner of a Google Drive folder shares editor, viewer, or commentor access with someone else.

RBAC is used when authorization is determined by a user's role within an organization. For example, a user in the marketing department may have access to user analytics but not network administration.

Competitors refers to rival companies who pose a threat because they might benefit from leaked information.

State actors are government intelligence agencies.

Criminal syndicates refer to organized groups of people who make money from criminal activity.

Insider threats can be any individual who has or had authorized access to an organization’s resources. This includes employees who accidentally compromise assets or individuals who purposefully put them at risk for their own benefit.

Shadow IT refers to individuals who use technologies that lack IT governance. A common example is when an employee uses their personal email to send work-related communications.

An advanced persistent threat (APT) refers to instances when a threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time. The term is mostly associated with nation states and state-sponsored actors. Typically, an APT is concerned with surveilling a target to gather information. They then use the intel to manipulate government, defense, financial, and telecom services.

Direct access, referring to instances when they have physical access to a system

Removable media, which includes portable hardware, like USB flash drives

Social media platforms that are used for communication and content sharing

Email, including both personal and business accounts

Wireless networks on premises

Cloud services usually provided by third-party organizations

Supply chains like third-party vendors that can present a backdoor into systems




Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

prepare. At this stage, attackers gather information about their target.

trust. This is often referred to as pretexting. Here, attackers use the information they gathered earlier to open a line of communication.

persuasion tactics. This stage is where the earlier preparation really matters. This is when the attacker manipulates their target into volunteering information.

disconnect from the target. After they collect the information they want, attackers break communication with their target. They disappear to cover their tracks.

Preventing social engineering:
1. Implementing managerial controls
2. Staying informed of trends
3. Sharing your knowledge with others

Baiting is a social engineering tactic that tempts people into compromising their security. A common example is USB baiting that relies on someone finding an infected USB drive and plugging it into their device.

Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. It is one of the most common forms of social engineering, typically performed via email.

Quid pro quo is a type of baiting used to trick someone into believing that they’ll be rewarded in return for sharing access, information, or money. For example, an attacker might impersonate a loan officer at a bank and call customers offering them a lower interest rate on their credit card. They'll tell the customers that they simply need to provide their account details to claim the deal.

Tailgating is a social engineering tactic in which unauthorized people follow an authorized person into a restricted area. This technique is also sometimes referred to as piggybacking.

Watering hole is a type of attack when a threat actor compromises a website frequently visited by a specific group of users. Oftentimes, these watering hole sites are infected with malicious software. An example is the Holy Water attack of 2020 that infected various religious, charity, and volunteer websites.

Encouraging caution:
1. Stay alert of suspicious communications and unknown people, especially when it comes to email. For example, look out for spelling errors and double-check the sender's name and email address.
2. Be cautious about sharing information, especially over social media. Threat actors often search these platforms for any information they can use to their advantage.
3. Control curiosity when something seems too good to be true. This can include wanting to click on attachments or links in emails and advertisements.

The first is malicious attachments. These are files that are infected and can cause harm to the organization's systems.

fake-data collection forms. These forms look like legitimate forms, like a survey. Unlike a real survey, they ask for sensitive information that isn't normally asked for in an email.

 fraudulent web links. These open to malicious web pages that are designed to look like trusted brands. Unlike actual websites, these fraudulent sites are built to steal information, like login credentials.

Smishing is the use of text messages to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source. You've probably received these types of messages before. Not only are smishing messages annoying to receive, they're also difficult to prevent. That's why some attackers send them.

Vishing is the exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or impersonate a known source. During vishing attacks, criminals pretend to be someone they're not. For example, attackers might call pretending to be a company representative. 

Email phishing is a type of attack sent via email in which threat actors send messages pretending to be a trusted person or entity.

Spear phishing is a subset of email phishing in which specific people are purposefully targeted, such as the accountants of a small business.

Whaling refers to a category of spear phishing attempts that are aimed at high-ranking executives in an organization.

Angler phishing is a technique where attackers impersonate customer service representatives on social media.

Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks.

A virus is malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.

A worm is malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. While viruses require users to perform an action like opening a file to duplicate, worms use an infected device as a host.

A trojan, or Trojan horse, is malware that looks like a legitimate file or program. The name is a reference to an ancient Greek legend that's set in the city of Troy.

Ransomware is a type of malicious attack where attackers encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.

Spyware is malware that's used to gather and sell information without consent. Consent is a keyword in this case.

Advertising-supported software, or adware, is a type of legitimate software that is sometimes used to display digital advertisements in applications.

A PUA is a type of unwanted software that is bundled in with legitimate programs which might display ads, cause device slowdown, or install other software.

scareware. This type of malware employs tactics to frighten users into infecting their own device.

Fileless malware does not need to be installed by the user because it uses legitimate programs that are already installed to infect a computer. This type of infection resides in memory where the malware never touches the hard drive.

A rootkit is malware that provides remote, administrative access to a computer. Most attackers use rootkits to open a backdoor to systems, allowing them to install other forms of malware or to conduct network security attacks.

A botnet, short for “robot network,” is a collection of computers infected by malware that are under the control of a single threat actor, known as the “bot-herder.” Viruses, worms, and trojans are often used to spread the initial infection and turn the devices into a bot for the bot-herder.

Cryptojacking is a form of malware that installs software to illegally mine cryptocurrencies.

An intrusion detection system, or IDS, is an application that monitors system activity and alerts some possible intrusions. When abnormal activity is detected like, malware mining for coins, the IDS alerts security personnel.

sign of a cryptojacking infection is slowdown. Other signs include increased CPU usage, sudden system crashes, and fast draining batteries. Another sign is unusually high electricity costs related to the resource- intensive process of crypto mining.

Web-based exploits are malicious code or behavior that's used to take advantage of coding flaws in a web application.

An injection attack is malicious code inserted into a vulnerable application. The infected application often appears to work normally.

Cross site scripting, or XSS, is an injection attack that inserts code into a vulnerable website or web application. These attacks are often delivered by exploiting the two languages used by most websites, HTML and JavaScript.

There are three main types of cross-site scripting attacks reflected, stored, and DOM-based:
1. A reflected XSS attack is an instance where a malicious script is sent to the server and activated during the server's response. A common example of this is the search bar of a website.
2. In a stored XSS attack, the malicious script isn't hidden in a link that needs to be sent to the server. Instead a stored XSS attack is an instance when malicious script is injected directly on the server.
3. DOM-based XSS. DOM stands for Document Object Model, which is basically the source code of a website. A DOM-based XSS attack is an instance when malicious script exists in the web page a browser loads. Unlike reflected XSS, these attacks don't need to be sent to the server to activate.

SQL is a programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database.

A SQL injection is an attack that executes unexpected queries on a database. Like cross-site scripting, SQL injection occurs due to a lack of sanitized input.

A prepared statement is a coding technique that executes SQL statements before passing them on to the database.

A database is an organized collection of information or data in one place.

A SQL query is a request for data from a database. 

In-band, or classic, SQL injection is the most common type. An in-band injection is one that uses the same communication channel to launch the attack and gather the results.

An out-of-band injection is one that uses a different communication channel  to launch the attack and gather the results.

Inferential SQL injection occurs when an attacker is unable to directly see the results of their attack. Instead, they can interpret the results by analyzing the behavior of the system.

Input sanitization: programming that removes user input which could be interpreted as code.

Input validation: programming that ensures user input meets a system's expectations.

Threat modeling is a process of identifying assets, their vulnerabilities, and how each is exposed to threats. We apply threat modeling to everything we protect.

In general, there are six steps of a threat model:
1. define the scope of the model. At this stage, the team determines what they're building by creating an inventory of assets and classifying them.
2. identify threats. Here, the team defines all potential threat actors. A threat actor is any person or group who presents a security risk. Threat actors are characterized as being internal or external.
3. characterize the environment. Here, the team applies an attacker mindset to the business. They consider how the customers and employees interact with the environment.
4. analyze threats. Here, the team works together to examine existing protections and identify gaps. They then rank threats according to their risk score that they assign.
5. how to mitigate risk. At this point, the group creates their plan for defending against threats. The choices here are to avoid risk, transfer it, reduce it, or accept it.
6. evaluate findings. At this stage, everything that was done during the exercise is documented, fixes are applied, and the team makes note of any successes they had. They also record any lessons learned, so they can inform how they approach future threat models.

PASTA is a popular threat modeling framework that's used across many industries. PASTA is short for Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis.

1. define business and security objectives. Before starting the threat model, the team needs to decide what their goals are.
2. define the technical scope. Here, the team's focus is to identify the application components that must be evaluated.
3. decompose the application. In other words, we need to identify the existing controls that will protect user data from threats.
4. perform a threat analysis. This is where the team gets into their attacker mindset.
5. performing a vulnerability analysis. In this stage, the team more deeply investigates potential vulnerabilities by considering the root of the problem.
6. conducts attack modeling. This is where the team tests the vulnerabilities that were analyzed in stage five by simulating attacks.
7. analyze risk and impact. Here, the team assembles all the information they've collected in stages one through six.

STRIDE is a threat-modeling framework developed by Microsoft. It’s commonly used to identify vulnerabilities in six specific attack vectors. The acronym represents each of these vectors: spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege.

Trike is an open source methodology and tool that takes a security-centric approach to threat modeling. It's commonly used to focus on security permissions, application use cases, privilege models, and other elements that support a secure environment.

The Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat (VAST) Modeling framework is part of an automated threat-modeling platform called ThreatModeler®. Many security teams opt to use VAST as a way of automating and streamlining their threat modeling assessments.

Threat modeling is the process of identifying assets, their vulnerabilities, and how each is exposed to threats. It is a strategic approach that combines various security activities, such as vulnerability management, threat analysis, and incident response.

Application programming interface (API): An API is a set of rules that define how software components interact with each other. In application development, third-party APIs are commonly used to add functionality without having to program it from scratch.

Public key infrastructure (PKI): PKI is an encryption framework that secures the exchange of online information.

The NIST incident response lifecycle is another NIST framework with additional substeps dedicated to incident response. It begins with preparation. Next, detection and analysis, and then containment, eradication and recovery, and finally post-incident activity.

an incident is "an occurrence that actually or imminently jeopardizes, without lawful authority, the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or an information system; or constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of law, security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies." Whoa, that's a lot to take in. Let's break it down.

An incident investigation reveals critical information about the five W's of an incident: who triggered the incident, what happened, when the incident took place, where the incident took place, and why the incident occurred.

Computer security incident response teams, or CSIRTs, are a specialized group of security professionals that are trained in incident management and response. The goal of CSIRTs are to effectively and efficiently manage incidents, provide services and resources for response and recovery, and prevent future incidents from occurring.

So how exactly does a CSIRT function? First, there's the security analyst. The analyst's job is to investigate security alerts to determine if an incident has occurred. If an incident has been detected, the analyst will determine the criticality rating of the incident. Some incidents can be easily remediated by the security analyst and don't require escalation. But if the incident is highly critical, it gets escalated to the technical lead, who provides technical leadership by guiding security incidents through their lifecycle.

During this time, the incident coordinator tracks and manages the activities of the CSIRT and other teams involved in the response effort. Their job is to ensure that incident response processes are followed and that teams are regularly updated on the incident status. Not all CSIRTs are the same. Depending on the organization, a CSIRT can also be referred to as an Incident Handling Team, or IHT, or Security Incident Response Team, SIRT. Depending on an organization's structure, some teams can also have a broader or specialized focus. For example, some teams may be solely dedicated to crisis management and others may be incorporated with a SOC. Roles can have different names too. For example, a technical lead can also be known as an Ops lead.

Command refers to having the appropriate leadership and direction to oversee the response.

Control refers to the ability to manage technical aspects during incident response, like coordinating resources and assigning tasks.

Communication refers to the ability to keep stakeholders informed.

Roles in CSIRTs:
1. Security analyst
2. Technical lead
3. Incident coordinator

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Incident Response Lifecycle, which is a framework for incident response consisting of four phases:
1. Preparation
2. Detection and Analysis
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
4. Post-incident activity

The job of the security analyst is to continuously monitor an environment for any security threats. This includes: 
1. Analyzing and triaging alerts
2. Performing root-cause investigations
3. Escalating or resolving alerts 

Technical lead
The job of the technical lead is to manage all of the technical aspects of the incident response process, such as applying software patches or updates. They do this by first determining the root cause of the incident. Then, they create and implement the strategies for containing, eradicating, and recovering from the incident.

Incident coordinator
Responding to an incident also requires cross-collaboration with nonsecurity professionals. CSIRTs will often consult with and leverage the expertise of members from external departments. The job of the incident coordinator is to coordinate with the relevant departments during a security incident.

A security operations center (SOC) is an organizational unit dedicated to monitoring networks, systems, and devices for security threats or attacks. Structurally, a SOC (usually pronounced "sock") often exists as its own separate unit or within a CSIRT.

Tier 1 SOC analyst
The first tier is composed of the least experienced SOC analysts who are known as level 1s (L1s). They are responsible for:

Monitoring, reviewing, and prioritizing alerts based on criticality or severity

Creating and closing alerts using ticketing systems

Escalating alert tickets to Tier 2 or Tier 3

Tier 2 SOC analyst
The second tier comprises the more experienced SOC analysts, or level 2s (L2s). They are responsible for: 

Receiving escalated tickets from L1 and conducting deeper investigations

Configuring and refining security tools

Reporting to the SOC Lead

Tier 3 SOC lead
The third tier of a SOC is composed of the SOC leads, or level 3s (L3s). These highly experienced professionals are responsible for:

Managing the operations of their team

Exploring methods of detection by performing advanced detection techniques, such as malware and forensics analysis

Reporting to the SOC manager

SOC manager 
The SOC manager is at the top of the pyramid and is responsible for: 

Hiring, training, and evaluating the SOC team members

Creating performance metrics and managing the performance of the SOC team

Developing reports related to incidents, compliance, and auditing

Communicating findings to stakeholders such as executive management   

Other roles
SOCs can also contain other specialized roles such as: 

Forensic investigators: Forensic investigators are commonly L2s and L3s who collect, preserve, and analyze digital evidence related to security incidents to determine what happened.

Threat hunters: Threat hunters are typically L3s who work to detect, analyze, and defend against new and advanced cybersecurity threats using threat intelligence.

An incident response plan is a document that outlines the procedures to take in each step of incident response.

Documentation is any form of recorded content that is used for a specific purpose.

An intrusion detection system is an application that monitors system and network activity, and produces alerts on possible intrusions.

Detection categories
As a security analyst, you will investigate alerts that an IDS generates. There are four types of detection categories you should be familiar with:

- A true positive is an alert that correctly detects the presence of an attack.
- A true negative is a state where there is no detection of malicious activity. This is when no malicious activity exists and no alert is triggered. 
- A false positive is an alert that incorrectly detects the presence of a threat. This is when an IDS identifies an activity as malicious, but it isn't. False positives are an inconvenience for security teams because they spend time and resources investigating an illegitimate alert. 
- A false negative is a state where the presence of a threat is not detected. This is when malicious activity happens but an IDS fails to detect it. False negatives are dangerous because security teams are left unaware of legitimate attacks that they can be vulnerable to. 

An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is an application that monitors system activity for intrusive activity and takes action to stop the activity.

Endpoint detection and response (EDR) is an application that monitors an endpoint for malicious activity. EDR tools are installed on endpoints. Remember that an endpoint is any device connected on a network. Examples include end-user devices, like computers, phones, tablets, and more.

SIEM is a tool that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization.

ecurity orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) is a collection of applications, tools, and workflows that uses automation to respond to security events.

Detection enables the prompt discovery of security events.

Analysis involves the investigation and validation of alerts. 

The challenge with detection is it's impossible to detect everything.

Analysts often receive a high volume of alerts per shift

Threat hunting is the proactive search for threats on a network. Security professionals use threat hunting to uncover malicious activity that was not identified by detection tools and as a way to do further analysis on detections.

 threat intelligence, which is evidence-based threat information that provides context about existing or emerging threats. 

Industry reports: These often include details about attacker's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).

Government advisories: Similar to industry reports, government advisories include details about attackers' TTP. 

Threat data feeds: Threat data feeds provide a stream of threat-related data that can be used to help protect against sophisticated attackers like advanced persistent threats (APTs). 

APTs are instances when a threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time. The data is usually a list of indicators like IP addresses, domains, and file hashes.

Cyber deception involves techniques that deliberately deceive malicious actors with the goal of increasing detection and improving defensive strategies.

Honeypots are an example of an active cyber defense mechanism that uses deception technology. Honeypots are systems or resources that are created as decoys vulnerable to attacks with the purpose of attracting potential intruders.

Indicators of compromise (IoCs) are observable evidence that suggests signs of a potential security incident. IoCs chart specific pieces of evidence that are associated with an attack, like a file name associated with a type of malware.

Indicators of attack (IoA) are the series of observed events that indicate a real-time incident.  IoAs focus on identifying the behavioral evidence of an attacker, including their methods and intentions.

Pyramid of Pain:

1. Hash values: Hashes that correspond to known malicious files. These are often used to provide unique references to specific samples of malware or to files involved in an intrusion.

2. IP addresses: An internet protocol address like 192.168.1.1

3. Domain names: A web address such as www.google.com 

4. Network artifacts: Observable evidence created by malicious actors on a network. For example, information found in network protocols such as User-Agent strings. 

5. Host artifacts: Observable evidence created by malicious actors on a host. A host is any device that’s connected on a network. For example, the name of a file created by malware.

6. Tools: Software that’s used by a malicious actor to achieve their goal. For example, attackers can use password cracking tools like John the Ripper to perform password attacks to gain access into an account.

7. Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs): This is the behavior of a malicious actor. Tactics refer to the high-level overview of the behavior. Techniques provide detailed descriptions of the behavior relating to the tactic. Procedures are highly detailed descriptions of the technique. TTPs are the hardest to detect. 

Threat intelligence is evidence-based threat information that provides context about existing or emerging threats.

Crowdsourcing is the practice of gathering information using public input and collaboration.

Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is the collection and analysis of information from publicly available sources to generate usable intelligence. OSINT can also be used as a method to gather information related to threat actors, threats, vulnerabilities, and more.

VirusTotal is a service that allows anyone to analyze suspicious files, domains, URLs, and IP addresses for malicious content. VirusTotal also offers additional services and tools for enterprise use. This reading focuses on the VirusTotal website, which is available for free and non-commercial use.

Detection: The Detection tab provides a list of third-party security vendors and their detection verdicts on an IoC. For example, vendors can list their detection verdict as malicious, suspicious, unsafe, and more.

Details: The Details tab provides additional information extracted from a static analysis of the IoC. Information such as different hashes, file types, file sizes, headers, creation time, and first and last submission information can all be found in this tab.

Relations: The Relations tab provides related IoCs that are somehow connected to an artifact, such as contacted URLs, domains, IP addresses, and dropped files if the artifact is an executable.

Behavior: The Behavior tab contains information related to the observed activity and behaviors of an artifact after executing it in a controlled or sandboxed environment. This information includes tactics and techniques detected, network communications, registry and file systems actions, processes, and more.

Community: The Community tab is where members of the VirusTotal community, such as security professionals or researchers, can leave comments and insights about the IoC. 

Vendors’ ratio and community score: The score displayed at the top of the report is the vendors’ ratio. The vendors’ ratio shows how many security vendors have flagged the IoC as malicious overall.

Chain of custody is the process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle.

Documentation is any form of recorded content that is used for a specific purpose, and it is essential in the field of security. Security teams use documentation to support investigations, complete tasks, and communicate findings.

transparency is critical for demonstrating compliance with regulations and internal processes, meeting insurance requirements, and for legal proceedings.

Standardization through repeatable processes and procedures supports continuous improvement efforts, helps with knowledge transfer, and facilitates the onboarding of new team members. Standards are references that inform how to set policies.

Ideally, all documentation provides clarity to its audience. Clear documentation helps people quickly access the information they need so they can take necessary action. Security analysts are required to document the reasoning behind any action they take so that it’s clear to their team why an alert was escalated or closed.

Travel itineraries are essential documents to have, especially for travel to a new place.

playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action.

non-automated playbook, which requires step-by-step actions performed by an analyst.

Triage is the prioritizing of incidents according to their level of importance or urgency. The triage process helps security teams evaluate and prioritize security alerts and allocate resources effectively so that the most critical issues are addressed first. 

receive and assess the alert to determine if it's a false positive and whether it's related to an existing incident.

assign priority on the alert based on the organization's policy and guidelines. The priority level defines how the organization's security team will respond to the incident.

collect and analyze any evidence associated with the alert, such as system logs.

Is the alert a false positive? Security analysts must determine whether the alert is a genuine security concern or a false positive, or an alert that incorrectly detects the presence of a threat.

Was this alert triggered in the past? If so, how was it resolved? The history of an alert can help determine whether the alert is a new or recurring issue. 

Is the alert triggered by a known vulnerability? If an alert is triggered by a known vulnerability, security analysts can leverage existing knowledge to determine an appropriate response and minimize the impact of the vulnerability. 

What is the severity of the alert? The severity of an alert can help determine the priority of the response so that critical issues are quickly escalated.

Functional impact: Security incidents that target information technology systems impact the service that these systems provide to its users.

Information impact: Incidents can affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization’s data and information. In a data exfiltration attack, malicious actors can steal sensitive data.

Recoverability: How an organization recovers from an incident depends on the size and scope of the incident and the amount of resources available. In some cases, recovery might not be possible, like when a malicious actor successfully steals proprietary data and shares it publicly.

Resource management: Triaging alerts allows security teams to focus their resources on threats that require urgent attention. This helps team members avoid dedicating time and resources to lower priority tasks and might also reduce response time.

Standardized approach: Triage provides a standardized approach to incident handling. Process documentation, like playbooks, help to move alerts through an iterative process to ensure that alerts are properly assessed and validated. This ensures that only valid alerts are moved up to investigate.

A log is a record of events that occur within an organization's systems.
Date, time, location, action, names

These include network logs, which are generated by devices such as proxies, routers, switches, and firewalls
system logs, which are generated by operating systems.
application logs, which are logs related to software applications
security logs, which are generated by security tools like IDS or IPS
authentication logs, which record login attempts.

Syslog is both a protocol and a log format. As a protocol, it transports and writes logs.
The header contains data fields like Timestamp, the Hostname, the Application name, and the Message ID.
The structured-data portion contains additional data information in key-value pairs.
Lastly, the message component contains the detailed log message about the event.

Protocol: The syslog protocol is used to transport logs to a centralized log server for log management. It uses port 514 for plaintext logs and port 6514 for encrypted logs.

Service: The syslog service acts as a log forwarding service that consolidates logs from multiple sources into a single location. The service works by receiving and then forwarding any syslog log entries to a remote server. 

Log format: The syslog log format is one of the most commonly used log formats that you will be focusing on. It is the native logging format used in  Unix® systems. It consists of three components: a header, structured-data, and a message.

A network-based intrusion detection system collects and analyzes network traffic and network data.

Signature analysis is a detection method used to find events of interest. 

Anomaly-based analysis is a detection method that identifies abnormal behavior. 
There are two phases to anomaly-based analysis: a training phase and a detection phase. In the training phase, a baseline of normal or expected behavior must be established. Baselines are developed by collecting data that corresponds to normal system behavior. 
In the detection phase, the current system activity is compared against this baseline. Activity that happens outside of the baseline gets logged, and an alert is generated. 

Collect and aggregate data: SIEM tools collect event data from various data sources.

Normalize data: Event data that's been collected becomes normalized. Normalization converts data into a standard format so that data is structured in a consistent way and becomes easier to read and search. While data normalization is a common feature in many SIEM tools, it's important to note that SIEM tools vary in their data normalization capabilities.

Analyze data: After the data is collected and normalized, SIEM tools analyze and correlate the data to identify common patterns that indicate unusual activity.

Log forwarders are software that automate the process of collecting and sending log data.
